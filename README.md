# Flask Proxy Server

A simple Flask web application that acts as a proxy server, allowing you to retrieve and display content from other websites.

## Features

- Proxies both GET and POST requests.
- Adds a base URL to content for static assets.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed
- [Flask](https://pypi.org/project/Flask/) installed (`pip install Flask`)
- [Requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) installed (`pip install requests`)

### Running the Application

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flask-proxy-server.git
   cd flask-proxy-server
   ```

2. Run the Flask application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   The application will be accessible at [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000).

3. Open your browser and navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:5000/proxy?url=http://example.com](http://127.0.0.1:5000/proxy?url=http://example.com) to test the proxy functionality.

## Usage

- Send a GET request to `/proxy` with the `url` parameter to retrieve content from the specified URL.
  Example: [http://127.0.0.1:5000/proxy?url=http://example.com](http://127.0.0.1:5000/proxy?url=http://example.com)
  
- Send a POST request to `/proxy` with the `url` parameter in the form data to retrieve content from the specified URL.
  Example using `curl`:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST -d "url=http://example.com" http://127.0.0.1:5000/proxy
  ```

## Configuration

- The application is set to run in debug mode. Update the `debug` parameter in `app.run()` for production deployment.
